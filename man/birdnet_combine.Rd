Reads and combines multiple BirdNET output .csv or .txt files from a specified directory
into a single data frame.
Files named with "analysis_params" or "CombinedTable" under the specified directory are automatically excluded.
}

This function is useful for aggregating BirdNET output from batch runs or large-scale deployments.
It uses a fixed column specification to ensure consistent parsing of each file. Files with incompatible
formats or errors are skipped and their names are printed with a warning.

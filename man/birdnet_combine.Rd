\title{Combine BirdNET output files from a directory}
\usage{
birdnet_combine(path, add_filepath = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Path to a directory containing BirdNET output files.}

\item{add_filepath}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds a column \code{filepath} to the
output data frame indicating the source file for each row. Use with
caution: if the input files already contain a column named \code{filepath},
it will be overwritten. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame combining all readable BirdNET \code{.csv} or \code{.txt} files found in the directory.
The column structure depends on the input files and is not standardized by this function.
}
\description{
Reads and combines multiple BirdNET output \code{.csv} or \code{.txt} files from a specified directory
(including subdirectories) into a single data frame.
}
\details{
Files named \code{"analysis_params"} or \code{"CombinedTable"} are automatically excluded. Files that are
empty or cannot be read are skipped. A summary of how many files were successfully read and which
files (if any) caused errors is printed at the end.

This function is useful for aggregating large batches of BirdNET results without requiring
consistent formatting. All subdirectories are searched recursively. Files are read using
\code{\link[readr:read_delim]{readr::read_delim()}}, and empty files are silently ignored.

If no valid files are found, or if all files are excluded or cause read errors, the function
aborts with an informative message.

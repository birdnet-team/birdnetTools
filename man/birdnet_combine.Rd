\title{Combine BirdNET output files from a directory}
\usage{
birdnet_combine(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Path to the directory containing BirdNET output files.}
}
\value{
A data frame combining all valid BirdNET output files found in the directory.
The column names and structure depend on the input files and are not standardized by this function.
}
\description{
Reads and combines multiple BirdNET output \code{.csv} or \code{.txt} files from a specified directory
into a single data frame. Subdirectories are searched recursively. Files named with
\code{"analysis_params"} or \code{"CombinedTable"} are automatically excluded.
}
\details{
Files are read using \code{readr::read_csv()}. Files that are empty or cannot be read are skipped.
A summary of the number of files combined and any files skipped due to error is printed at the end.

This function is useful for aggregating large batches of BirdNET results without requiring consistent formatting.

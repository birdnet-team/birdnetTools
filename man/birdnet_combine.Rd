\item{path}{Character string. The directory path containing BirdNET output \code{.csv} files. Can include subdirectories.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the combined BirdNET detection data from all valid CSV files, with columns:

\description{
Reads and combines multiple BirdNET output CSV files from a specified directory into a single data frame.
Files named with "analysis_params" or "CombinedTable" under the specified directory are automatically excluded.
}
\details{
This function is useful for aggregating BirdNET output from batch runs or large-scale deployments.
It uses a fixed column specification to ensure consistent parsing of each file. Files with incompatible
formats or errors are skipped and their names are printed with a warning.

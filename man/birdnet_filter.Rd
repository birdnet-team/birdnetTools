\title{Filter BirdNET output data by species, confidence, date, and time}
\usage{
birdnet_filter(
  data,
  species = NULL,
  threshold = NULL,
  year = NULL,
  min_date = NULL,
  max_date = NULL,
  hour = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing BirdNET output. Column names will be standardized internally
using \code{\link[=birdnet_clean_names]{birdnet_clean_names()}}.}

\item{species}{Character vector. One or more common names of the species to filter by (e.g., \code{c("Swainson's Thrush", "American Robin")}).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Confidence threshold (between 0 and 1); rows with confidence below
this value will be excluded.}

\item{year}{Integer or vector of integers. Year(s) to retain in the data (e.g., \code{c(2024:2025)}).}

\item{min_date, max_date}{Character strings or \code{Date} objects specifying the date range (inclusive).
If only one is provided, filtering is open-ended on the other side (e.g., "2025-06-09").}

\item{hour}{Integer vector between 0 and 23 specifying which hours of the day to keep (e.g., \code{c(4:7)}).}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame with a \code{"filter_log"} attribute containing the filtering parameters used.
}
\description{
Applies one or more common filtering operations to a BirdNET output dataframe.
This includes filtering by species name, confidence threshold, year, date range, and hour range.
The function also records the filtering parameters as an attribute (\code{filter_log})
attached to the returned dataframe, allowing users to inspect what filters were applied.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
filtered <- birdnet_filter(data,
  species = "Swainson's Thrush",
  threshold = 0.75
)
attr(filtered, "filter_log")

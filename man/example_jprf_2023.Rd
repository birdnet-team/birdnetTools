\item{start}{Start time of the detection in seconds}
\item{end}{End time of the detection in seconds}
\item{scientific_name}{Scientific name of the detected species or sound event}
\item{common_name}{Common name of the detected species or sound event}
\item{confidence}{BirdNET-assigned confidence score (0 to 1)}
\item{lat}{Latitude of the recording location (set to -1 if not embedded)}
\item{lon}{Longitude of the recording location (set to -1 if not embedded)}
\item{week}{Week number of the year (set to -1 if not available)}
\item{overlap}{Whether overlapping segments were analyzed (0 = no, 1 = yes)}
\item{sensitivity}{Sensitivity parameter used during detection (default = 1)}
\item{min_conf}{Minimum confidence threshold used during detection (e.g., 0.1)}
\item{species_list}{Species list constraint used (e.g., "None" if not set)}
\item{model}{Name of the BirdNET model used for detection}

\description{
A sample BirdNET selection table generated from audio recordings collected
from 5 sites, in John Prince Research Forest, British Columbia, Canada, during
Mayâ€“June 2023. Recordings were scheduled continuously over 24 hours using a duty
cycle of 1 minute on, 4 minutes off. Audio files were analyzed using the BirdNET GUI
(model version 2.4) with a confidence threshold of 0.1; all other parameters were
kept at their default values.
}
\details{
This dataset is useful for demonstrating typical BirdNET output and testing
workflows involving species filtering, thresholding, and temporal subsetting.

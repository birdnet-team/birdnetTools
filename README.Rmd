The goal of birdnetTools is to provide a streamlined set of tools for processing, validating, and visualizing output from the BirdNET sound analysis algorithm. This package helps ecologists and researchers efficiently interpret BirdNET results.


## Installation

You can install the development version of birdnetTools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("birdnet-team/birdnetTools")
```

## Example use

This is a basic example to show how to visualize BirdNET output data. The example assumes you have a data frame with BirdNET results:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(birdnetTools)

# to read data from a local path
data <- birdnet_combine("path/to/BirdNET/output")

# to filter data for given species, and time range
data_filtered <- birdnet_filter(data, 
                                species = "American Robin",
                                year = 2023,
                                date_range = c("2023-01-01", "2023-12-31"))

# to subsample dataset for validation purpose
data_subsampled <- birdnet_subsample(data_filtered, 
                                     n = 1000, 
                                     method = "stratified")

# data visualization
birdnet_heatmap(data_filtered)
  
  
```



### Funding

This project is supported by Jake Holshuh (Cornell class of '69) and The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations. Our work in the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics is made possible by the generosity of K. Lisa Yang to advance innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats.

The development of BirdNET is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the project “BirdNET+” (FKZ 01|S22072). The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety contributes through the “DeepBirdDetect” project (FKZ 67KI31040E). In addition, the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt supports BirdNET through the project “RangerSound” (project 39263/01).


### Partners

BirdNET is a joint effort of partners from academia and industry. Without these partnerships, this project would not have been possible.
